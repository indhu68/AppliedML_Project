Deep Learning applications in Vehicular Wireless Communication

In vehicular communications, challenges such as intracell interference and stringent latency requirements present significant hurdles. This paper addresses these issues by formulating a joint spectrum reuse and power allocation problem tailored for hybrid vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications systems.

Recognizing the critical need for high capacity in V2I links and low latency in V2V communications, our approach seeks to optimize a weighted sum of the capacities and latency requirements. The solution strategy involves decomposing the original complex problem into more manageable classification and regression subproblems.
